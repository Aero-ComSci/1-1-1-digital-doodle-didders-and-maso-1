# Aditi Vashist and Mason Teki's Digital Doodle!!

1. Anyone who wants to draw on or edit their photos can use this app. Our app has a variety of color options and features for the user.
2.  The user can take a picture, select colors to draw with, draw on their picture, then shake the screen to clear the canvas or use the erase tool. A paintbrush on the screen will follow the user's finger as they draw so the user can see where they are drawing.
